GSDA - Sine template-based gait detection algorithm
 
During normal walking, an acceleration signal, recorded using a lower back sensor, has a repeatable pattern in frequencies between 0.5-3.0 Hz. To minimize false detection of gait, the signal is band-passed filtered [0.5-3.0 Hz] to extract only the gait frequencies and to remove noises and harmonies of the walk. The next stage of the algorithm uses a running window of 3 seconds with 50% overlap on the vertical and anterior-posterior acceleration axes. The data from these windows is convolved with a 2 Hz sinusoidal signal that represents a cycle of gait in the filtered data. The resultant signal enables the detection of gait by searching for local maxima which represent one gait cycle. Only windows with 2â€“9 steps were considered as potential gait and only if detected at both axes. This range was chosen since gait typically takes place in the range of 0.5-3.0 Hz where 0.5 Hz reflects a stride every two seconds and 3.0 Hz reflects 3 steps every second. 
Additional post-processing is used to make sure that the windows contain gait. The average value of the signal should be above 0.5 [g] for the vertical axis. Otherwise, the subject is not in a standing position (e.g. lying). To remove transitions such as stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand, the mean values of the first and last seconds are compared using 3 seconds windows. If the mean value of the last second deviates by more than 15% from the one in the first second, the window is marked as non-gait. In the final stage only walking bouts longer than 5 seconds are kept.
